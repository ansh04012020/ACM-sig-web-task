  <br>
   <hr>
       <p style="font-size: 150%;">A <strong>coronavirus</strong> is a kind of common virus that causes an <mark>infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat</mark>. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the <strong>World Health Organization</strong> (<abbr title="World Health Organisation"><a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank">WHO</a></abbr>) identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.</p>
        <br>
        <section style="font-size:150%">COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a   <em>Respiratory Tract Infection</em>.<b>It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs)</b>.
        It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through<mark> person-to-person contact</mark>. Infections range from mild to deadly.
        <br>
        
        SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.</section>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="background-color: rgb(219, 255, 102);"><u>Is there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2?</u></h2>
        
        <p style="font-size:150%;">An early Chinese study of 103 COVID-19 cases found two strains, which they named L and S. The S type is older, but the L type was more common in early stages of the outbreak. They think one may cause more cases of the disease than the other, but they’re still working on what it all means. 
        
        It is also normal for a virus to change, or mutate, as it infects people and this virus has done so. There are several variants which have been named for the regions they were first discovered but they have now spread to other areas and countries.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <h2 style="background-color: rgb(219, 255, 102);"><u>How long will the coronavirus last?</u></h2>
        
        <p style="font-size:150%;">There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors, including the public’s efforts to slow the spread, researchers’ work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of the vaccines.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms of COVID-19</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 150%;"> The main symptoms include:
       <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"> <img src="symp.jpg" alt="Maintain Social Distancing" width="600" height="330" style="float: right;">
        <li style="font-size: 150%;">Coughing</li> 
        <li style="font-size: 150%;">Shortness of breath</li> 
        
        <li style="font-size: 150%;">Fatigue</li>
        <li style="font-size: 150%;">Chills, sometimes with shaking</li> 
        <li style="font-size: 150%;">Body aches</li>
        <li style="font-size: 150%;">Headache</li>

       <p style="font-size: 150%;">The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs. <br>

Even if you have mild symptoms like a headache and runny nose, stay in until you’re better. This lets doctors focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care workers and people you might meet along the way. You might hear this called self-quarantine. Try to stay in a separate room away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can.</p>
